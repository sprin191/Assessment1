When the page loads, have a button on the DOM that reads Generate. Upon clicking that button, append a new container onto the DOM. That new container should have two buttons, one that reads Delete, the other that reads Change Color. Additionally, there should be text that provides a number in the container. The number should be the number of times the Generate button has been clicked so far.

The Delete button should delete JUST the container that button is in. The Change Color button should change the background-color of the container to red. The default (or normal) state of the background-color should be yellow. Clicking the Change Color button a second time should change it back to yellow, 3rd time red, 4th time yellow, etc.

REMEMBER: Do not add in anything additional beyond what is required. The goal is not to be clever here, it is to execute on the provided instructions.
